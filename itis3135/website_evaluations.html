        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" > Good Website</a>
        <p> <u>amazon.com</u> offical website for <em>Amazon</em>. This website is a place where people come together to buy and sell items via the Internt.
        Amazon does a very good job employing the principles of CRAP </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrast: Like the way they used many fonts, sizes, colors, etc.  Allows me to see things clearly and easily.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repetition: Similar style across entire website.  Makes it consistent and easy to use. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Alignment: The text and pictures on the website are formatted correctly.  This allows me as a consumer to see everything in a well layed out manner.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity: This website does an excellent job using proximity.  It keeps things that need to be close to each other close.  This allows me to see what goes together
                and what doesn't.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <a href="https://www.pennyjuice.com/"> Bad Website</a>

        <p>This is the link for<em>Penny Juice </em>. Their website advertises their jucies and why you should buy them.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrast: There is way too much contrast.  The person who designed this website didn't think things through when considering
                contrast.
            <li>
                Repetition: Repetition on this website is almost non-existent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alignment: The alignment on this website is all over the place.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity: Since the alignment is poor, this makes it difficult to tell where things are in relation to one another.
                Therefore, their use of proximity is also sub-optimal.
            </li>
        </ul>
